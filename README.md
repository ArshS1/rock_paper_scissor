# rock_paper_scissor

This program is built using python solely; Tkinter, Pillow, and random librareis are used to make the rock, paper, and scissor more fun for the user. 
Screenshots of the gui are attached in the master repo along with the files that were used in order to make the program. 
The program allows the user to make a choice between rock, paper, scissor and then compete with an AI that chooses actions randomly. The score is tracked on the 
graphical window itself. Lastly, the user can exit the project if needed through the button avaliable.
